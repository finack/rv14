This repository contains Python scripts and DXF files for creating antenna doublers for various aircraft models, including RV-14 and GA models.

## Files

- **ci-105-doubler.py**: Script for CI-105 antenna doubler
- **ci105_doubler_v0.2.dxf**: DXF file for CI-105 antenna doubler (version 0.2)
- **ga-37-doubler.py**: Script for GA-37 antenna doubler
- **ga-57x-doubler.py**: Script for GA-57X antenna doubler
- **ga35_doubler_v0.2.dxf**: DXF file for GA-35 antenna doubler (version 0.2)
- **ga57x_doubler_v0.2.dxf**: DXF file for GA-57X antenna doubler (version 0.2)

## Purpose

These scripts generate doubler plates that reinforce the aircraft skin around antenna installations. The DXF files are ready-to-use templates for manufacturing.
